Description: Least-squares minimization and curve fitting
 A self-contained implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
 Routine lmmin determines a parameter vector p that minimizes the Euclidean
 norm of a vectorial function v(p). The most important application is curve
 fitting: to approximate data y(t) by a function f(t;p), routine lmcurve_fit
 minimizes the norm of the residual vector v = y(t) - f(t;p).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
