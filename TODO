TODO
- writeup
- code cleanup
  - compute nfev from outer*n+inner
- monitoring
  - tabular form, all in one line
  - also print currect direction and change angle
       (requires understanding of diag-scaling)
- long-term aims
  - full test suite
  - improve core algorithm as described in some literature?
  - estimate parameter errors via smallest-gradient ascent
